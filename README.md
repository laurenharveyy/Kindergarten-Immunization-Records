### Question 1: Which counties have the highest vaccination rates? The lowest?
1. Create a pivot table using the Student Data File. Make the row County and the Value a SUM of nDTP (number of students reporting DTP vaccination)
2. Copy and paste the results into another sheet
3. Create another pivot table using the Student Data File. Make the row County and the Value a SUM of n (number of students enrolled at each school)
4. Copy and paste just the SUM of n into the sheet next to the nDTP data. Make sure each value is aligned with the appropriate county. Create a new column and title in DTP_Rate. In the first row, input the equation =B2/C2. Use autofill or the dragging feature to extend this formula to all cells in the column.
5. Convert the resulting values in DTP_Rate into percentages using the "123" feature in the toolbar
6. Sort the percentages from largest to smallest (Z --> A) to get the counties with the highest vaccination rates.
7. Sort the percentages from smallest to largest (A --> Z) to get the counties with the lowest vaccination rates.
